Car Price Prediction with Machine Learning

Objective:
To build a predictive model that estimates the price of a car based on various features such as brand, fuel type, horsepower, and mileage using machine learning techniques.

Steps Performed:
Data loading and exploration to understand the dataset.
Data cleaning and preprocessing, including handling missing values and encoding categorical variables.
Splitting the data into training and testing sets for model validation.
Training a Linear Regression model to learn the relationship between car features and price.
Evaluating the modelâ€™s performance using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared metrics.
Visualizing the predicted prices against actual prices to assess accuracy.

Tools Used:
Python libraries including Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, and Seaborn within a Jupyter Notebook environment.

Outcome:
A trained machine learning model capable of predicting car prices with reasonable accuracy, demonstrating practical application of regression techniques in real-world data analysis.
